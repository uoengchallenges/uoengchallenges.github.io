      <h3>40 Beers</h3>
      <p>Drink 40 beers within 24h, no pukes.</p>

      <h3>Centurion</h3>
      <p>Complete the century club in its entirety without throwing up. This consists of having a sip/shot of your drink every minute for 100 minutes.</p>

      <h3>Wizard</h3>
      <p>In a 12 hour time span, you must drink your height in beer. This means, every time you crack a new beer, tape it to the top of the previous one, until it is the same height or taller than you. The skinny 355mL cans are cheating. </p>

      <h3>Coventryman</h3>
      <p>Wear the coveralls all day every weekday for an entire semester. If one is caught without their coveralls and a picture is taken, the attempt is invalidated.</p>

      <h3>Pool Party</h3>
      <p>Fill a kiddie pool with drink, you can't exit it until you've drunk it all.</p>

      <h3>Gremlin</h3>
      <p>Spend 24 hours straight in SITE/CBY, the only way to go between the buildings is the tunnels, cannot go outside.</p>

      <h3>Study Hard</h3>
      <p>Do a shotgun in every study room in CRX floor 5. You may not leave the floor until the challenge is completed. Getting caught by security invalidates the attempt.</p>

      <h3>Sunday Service</h3>
      <p>Make it to breakfast.</p>

      <h3>Double Feature</h3>
      <p>Close the bar Monday of 101 week, make it to Shine Day at 6am SHARP, and close the bar once again that night. You CANNOT skip Messy Day.</p>

      <h3>Champ</h3>
      <p>Win an intramural league with an engineering team.</p>

      <h3>Crayon Master</h3>
      <p>Show up to a business midterm with a pack of crayons and take it. Get someone from the class to show you a corrected version. You must have obtained a grade higher than 50% to complete the challenge. Bonus points if you eat crayons during the exam.</p>

      <h3>Drunken douze</h3>
      <p>Travel 12 km on foot, have a drink at each kilometer marker. </p>
